1. Compile and test kernel module hbootmod
 (we need to change memory remapping functions for OMAP3430 platform, see build_l1_table() function in hboot.c
 for use processor specific features we can see cpu_v7_ functions from proc_v7.S from linux kernel)

- Also we need to rewrite buffer memory allocating functions to be more portable and tiny
- Recalculate and rewrite some constants in headers in boot directory.
- Cleanup asm code in boot/div.S
- Rename all constants for UNIVERSAL_* and define them in file plat.h with #ifdefs ARCH
- Move all arch constants and structures in plat header files
- Cleanup OMAP3430 and USB header and rename constants to UNIVERSAL names
 
2. Rewrite userspace tool and test it on stock boot.img

3. Rewrite bootloader (or port u-boot) to create custom booting service:
 boot kernel image from file;
 boot kernel image from USB (fastboot);
 boot kernel image from network (network boot).

4. Write automatic build and clean system (build.sh)

5. Add any of needed features to bootloader/bootmod/userspace utility

6. Add more portability and support of other platforms and kernels, use more assembler
