1. Compile and test kernel module hbootmod
 (we need to change memory remapping functions for OMAP3430 platform, see build_l1_table() function in hboot.c
 for use processor specific features we can see cpu_v7_ functions from proc_v7.S from linux kernel)
 Also we need to rewrite buffer memory allocating functions to be more portable and tiny (make building modules
 symply by command "make")

2. Rewrite userspace tool and test it on stock boot.img

3. Rewrite bootloader (or port u-boot) to create custom booting service:
 boot kernel image from file;
 boot kernel image from USB (fastboot);
 boot kernel image from network (network boot).

4. Add any of needed features to bootloader/bootmod/userspace utility

5. Add more portability and support of other platforms and kernels, use more assembler
