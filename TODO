1. Compile and test kernel module hbootmod
 (we need to change memory remapping functions for OMAP3430 platform, see build_l1_table() function in hboot.c
 for use processor specific features we can see cpu_v7_ functions from proc_v7.S from linux kernel)

2. Rewrite userspace tool and test it on stock boot.img

3. Rewrite bootloader (or port u-boot) to create custom booting service:
 boot kernel image from file;
 boot kernel image from USB (fastboot);
 boot kernel image from network (network boot).

4. Add any of needed features to bootloader/bootmod/userspace utility
